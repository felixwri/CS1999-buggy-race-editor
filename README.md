CS1999: Buggy Race Editor
=========================

> This is the "buggy editor" component of the Foundation Year Computer Science
> project at RHUL.

## Three.js

Currently using the un-minified version to help development but will swap it out at the end *it is around half the size*

## Page icon

OC created in photoshop

## Svg icons

All .svg are from google icons

## Prices.js

prices.js exports a json object of all the prices for each multiple choice 
and provides the units aswell so ```prices["power_type"].units === "power_units" ```
