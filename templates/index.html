  <h1>
    Buggy Developer
  </h1>

  <p>
    Use this editor to specify a racing buggy. The editor saves it in its
    little database and generates JSON data for the buggy. This is the data you
    need to supply when you log into the
    <strong><a href="{{ server_url }}">race server</a></strong> and enter your
    buggy into the next race.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that if your data is not accepted by the race server, your buggy
    will be disqualified from that race... so make sure you program your editor
    correctly.
